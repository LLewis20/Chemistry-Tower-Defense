# Chemistry-Tower-Defense

## Description
The main goal of this project is to produce a fun and interactive game that still is able to teach or aid current learning methods. For this project it will be over Acids and Bases within chemistry. The game will be a tower defense game where the player will have to place towers that represent different bases to defend against the incoming waves of acids. The player will have to answer questions from flask that randomly spawn around the map to gain in game currency to place more towers, if the player does not answer correctly the player will loose life. The game currently has two types of multiple choice questions which are classification of acids and bases and balancing chemical equations.

## Installation
To install the game currently you will have to clone the repository and run the game through the Godot engine. A playable version of the game should be hosted here on [Itch.io](https://llewis20.itch.io/chemistry-tower-defense) currently. 

For the future of this project we should plan to host the game through an web application so that we do not have to rely on another hosting service.
